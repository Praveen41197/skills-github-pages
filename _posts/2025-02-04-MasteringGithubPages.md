Introduction

In today's digital age, having an online presence is crucial. Whether you're a developer, writer, or hobbyist, GitHub Pages offers a simple and effective way to create a personal website or blog. In this post, I'll share my journey of learning GitHub Pages and how you can get started too.

Getting Started with GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is a free service provided by GitHub that allows you to host static websites directly from a GitHub repository. The process is straightforward and can be broken down into a few simple steps:

Create a Repository: Start by creating a new repository on GitHub. Name it <username>.github.io to ensure it gets recognized as a GitHub Pages site.

Enable GitHub Pages: Navigate to the repository settings and enable GitHub Pages. Select a branch (usually main or gh-pages) and choose a theme if desired.

Configure Your Site: Customize your site by editing the _config.yml file. This file contains settings such as the site title, description, and theme.

Create Content: Add content to your site by creating Markdown files. For blog posts, create files in the _posts directory with the format YYYY-MM-DD-title.md.

Writing Your First Blog Post

Creating a blog post with GitHub Pages and Jekyll is simple. Here's a step-by-step guide:

Create a New File: In your repository, navigate to the _posts directory and create a new file named YYYY-MM-DD-title.md.

Add Frontmatter: At the top of your file, include the following frontmatter:

yaml
---
title: "Your Blog Post Title"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
---
Write Your Content: Below the frontmatter, write your blog post using Markdown. Markdown allows you to format text easily with headers, lists, links, and more.

Commit Your Changes: Save and commit your changes to the repository. GitHub Pages will automatically build and publish your new post.

Conclusion

Learning GitHub Pages is a rewarding experience that empowers you to create and share your content with the world. With its user-friendly interface and powerful features, GitHub Pages is an excellent tool for anyone looking to establish an online presence. Happy blogging!
